    SENTRY_DSN is set — a deployment without an error-tracking backend behaves
    exactly as before. Works unmodified against GlitchTip (self-hosted,
    Sentry-protocol-compatible) or Sentry Cloud EU — only the DSN differs.

    Domain exceptions (LookupError/PermissionError/ValueError/IntegrityError/...)
    are all caught by configure_exception_handlers before they can propagate,
    so only genuinely unhandled bugs ever reach here — no extra 4xx filtering
    needed on top of the SDK's default (it only reports 5xx by default).
